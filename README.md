# Project:
## Title:
# c04-Code-Quiz

## Description:
As for our fourth week of homework for this assignment we (Columbia Engineering Bootcamp students) were given the following user story below and acceptance criteria:

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
This was a very difficult homework, probably the hardest yet with requirements to make a game. I had to pull from multiple resources and previous assignments to create this. The game also saves your initials using local storage. This was my first time using local storage and I definitely need some practice. Game logic in my opinion is the hardest logic to master. Looking forward to making more games.

Thanks for reading!
